*******************************************************************************
The folder stands for Modern PHP Web Development project UDM-section with mysql
*******************************************************************************
1. Create index.php file.
2. Add new folder includes, css folder, scripts folder and db folder.
    We include bootstrap to our page etc
    Header.php and footer.php in includes folder 

Include our site.css under bootstrap in index.php


----
for datepicker, use jqueryui site
and include all the scripts it has. There may be a conflict with jquery version we added so add them all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For succeeding registration we use card component bootstrao to style it.

-----------------------------------
Create our Database for storing our registrations


jumb to localhost/phpmyadmin
And create the two tables and the db.
*****************************************
Create a file that will handle the db and connect it with our site.
conn.php in db folder 
Another file crud.php stands for create read update and delete.
It will be sorted there all the functions and code associated with these operations.

After setting a succesful connection and creation of crud file, we then include it into
conn file.

We will now chech if we have any values from POST method to store before continuing.
-if submit value exists.---- if(isset($variable)) means if exists
===After succedding we will go and see our records.
We ll use bootstrap to use a nav on top of the pgae,
so it will help us go and see our records.
We choose a navbar and we put it to the header, cause we want it available to all pages.

------------------
After including and changing title, we want to read the records. 
So we go to crud fileand make another function,
to handle this action. getAttendees().
Then we go to viewrecords.php
and create a table so we can see the results.
Dynamically we make those rows for the results.
.
We make a variable$results and by using crud we attache the results of the function 
getAttendees we created.
============================
For taking the name of specialty instead of id,
we make a function.Then a variable index.php to handle the results
and then we modify the html in index.php
**********************************************
We now create a neew page called view. We will see the details
of an input by its id.

We add an errormessage.php and successmessage.php file in the includes.
Then we go to boootstrap on alerts components and copy the codes green and red alerts.
***************************************************************************************
No we will add it to github.
File -> Add local repository
Publish it etc..

If we go on heroku there will not shown anything.
The reason for this is because we do not have our db connected
over the internet to see it heroku.Instead it is connected locally.
So 1st way is clearDB mysql but its not free
Another way is remotemysql.com with workbench.

After connecting and passing from phpmyadmin database to workbench,
go to visual studio code to conn.php file
*******************************************
in case remotemysql doesn't work, we have two alternatives :
    https://www.freesqldatabase.com/freemysqldatabase/

    https://www.freemysqlhosting.net/register/?action=register
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we will create a folder into db user.php for preventing
publicly to see all tha parts of the app.Not all the pages.

============================================================================================
In includes folder we create a file named session.php. where we will start making
our restrictions for sensitive info.
There are super variables when a site loads like cookies ,session etc..
Cookies are on person machine, while session is storedon server.


After modifying to put login link on the right of top bar, we will create the page.
login.php


=======
===================================================================
For creating authority on some pages so than they cannot be seen, lik edit, view etc,
we create a new file inside includes folder Name it auth_check.php
We include that into viewrecords.php,view.php, edit.php, delete.php,
